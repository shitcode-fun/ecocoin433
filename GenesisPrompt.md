# Project Overview: EcoCoin Space

EcoCoin Space is a next-generation, blockchain-powered web application designed to promote environmental sustainability through an engaging game. By cultivating virtual trees in their eco-domains, users earn EcoCoin rewards, fostering a platform where eco-friendly practices are not just encouraged but rewarded. This application aims to educate users on sustainable living, protect species, and champion recycling, all while offering a fun, interactive platform that bridges the gap between digital and real-world ecological impact.
